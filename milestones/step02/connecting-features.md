Now that you have determined the needs of the user and the possible features that could address these needs, you can start to lace together a high level understanding of how these features connect. 

Flow Diagram: 
A flow diagram documents the tasks the user will perform, in relation to each other and over time. Create flows for the primary tasks, but keep this in sketch or text form (best to not dwell on how it looks at this stage but rather how these elements connect to each other).

Site Architecture: 
Another method to determining this network would be to quickly jot down the architecture of the project. Marking pages or features horizontally shows relative breadth, while nesting pages or features below those pages shows depth, and can help hint at how “flat” or “deep” an experience would be.
